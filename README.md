# Building-Amazon-clone-using-HTML-and-CSS
Front page of amazon website using only the skills from HTML and CSS

I built a mock Amazon front page using only HTML and CSS, without JavaScript,
to showcase my layout and styling skills.

Visual Studio is used along with a Live server to view the website in chrome page.
